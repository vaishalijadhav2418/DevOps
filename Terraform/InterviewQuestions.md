    What is Terraform, and how does it differ from other infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools?
    Explain the core components of Terraform, such as providers, resources, and modules.
    How would you secure sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, when using Terraform configurations?
    What is Terraform's "state," and why is it critical to managing infrastructure? How can you manage remote state in Terraform?
    What are Terraform providers, and why are they essential in managing resources from various cloud providers and services?
    Describe the difference between Terraform's "immutable" and "mutable" infrastructure approaches. When would you use each one?
    Explain the concept of "Terraform Modules" and their benefits in managing reusable infrastructure code.
    How do you handle dependency management between resources in Terraform?
    What are Terraform workspaces, and how can they be used to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production)?
    Discuss the advantages of using remote backends, such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage, for Terraform state storage.
    Explain the process of versioning and sharing Terraform configurations with your team. What are the best practices for managing Terraform code in a collaborative environment?
    How would you handle the upgrade of Terraform and the associated provider plugins in an existing project?
    Describe the key differences between Terraform and other IaC tools like Ansible and Puppet. In which scenarios would you choose one over the others?
    What is the role of "remote-exec" or "provisioners" in Terraform, and when should you use them?
    Explain the concept of Terraform "state locking" and its importance in a multi-user or multi-environment setup.
    Share an example of a complex Terraform project you've worked on, highlighting the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

  Scenario:
    You are tasked with provisioning a web application stack consisting of multiple AWS resources, including EC2 instances, an RDS database, and an Elastic Load Balancer. How would you structure your Terraform configuration to create this infrastructure?
    Your team is adopting a multi-environment strategy (e.g., dev, staging, production) using Terraform workspaces. Explain how you would organize your Terraform code and workspaces to manage these environments efficiently.
    You need to manage different sets of configuration values for your Terraform configurations, such as variable values, across various environments. How would you handle environment-specific configurations while maintaining code reusability?
    You have been given the task of implementing a zero-downtime deployment strategy for a critical application using Terraform. Describe how you would orchestrate this deployment, taking into account blue-green or canary deployment techniques.
    Your organization is moving towards a GitOps workflow for infrastructure management. How would you integrate Terraform with a GitOps toolchain, such as ArgoCD, Bitbucket, GitLab to automate infrastructure changes?
    You are responsible for managing a large number of AWS resources using Terraform. Explain the strategies and best practices you would use to keep your Terraform state files manageable and maintainable.
    Your team is using Terraform to manage resources across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. How would you structure your Terraform configuration to handle this multi-cloud setup effectively?
    You want to ensure that your Terraform configurations follow security best practices. What specific security considerations and configurations would you implement in your Terraform code?
    You are working in a regulated industry, and compliance is crucial. How would you use Terraform to ensure compliance with industry-specific regulations and security standards?
    Your team is using a CI/CD pipeline for deploying Terraform configurations. Describe the pipeline's stages and how it ensures safe and efficient infrastructure changes.
