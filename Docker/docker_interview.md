6. **What is Docker Hub?**
   A cloud-based registry for storing and distributing Docker images ([vskills.in][1]).

7. **How to check installed Docker version?**
   Run `docker --version` or `docker version`.

8. **What is a Dockerfile?**
   A script with instructions to build a Docker image ([vskills.in][1]).

    Use `--cpus` and `-m` flags with `docker run` ([sevenmentor.com][10], [geeksforgeeks.org][4]).

33. **Data persistence strategies?**
    Use Docker volumes, bind mounts, or external storage ([sevenmentor.com][10]).

34. **SecComp and resource limiting?**
    Use seccomp profiles and `--cpus/--memory` to restrict container capabilities and resource usage ([datacamp.com][12]).

35. **Container isolation?**
    Uses Linux namespaces and cgroups for process, network, and resource isolation .

36. **Docker content trust?**

Here are the **most common Docker errors**, their **causes**, and how to **fix or troubleshoot** themâ€”helpful for both interviews and real-world debugging:

---

### ðŸš« **Common Docker Errors & Solutions**

---

#### 1. **`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`**

**Error:**

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

**Cause:**
Docker service is not running or the user doesnâ€™t have permission.

**Fix:**

* Start Docker:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start docker
  ```
* Add user to Docker group:

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  newgrp docker
  ```

---

#### 2. **`No such container/image/network/volume`**

**Error:**

```
Error: No such container: myapp
```

**Cause:**
You're referring to a name or ID that doesn't exist.

**Fix:**

* Check with:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a      # for containers
  docker images     # for images
  docker volume ls  # for volumes
  ```

---

#### 3. **`Port is already allocated`**

**Error:**

```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated
```

**Cause:**
Another service or container is already using the port.

**Fix:**

* Find the process:

  ```bash
  sudo lsof -i :80
  ```
* Kill it or change the port in `docker run -p` or `docker-compose.yml`

---

#### 4. **`Image not found`**

**Error:**

```
Error response from daemon: pull access denied for myimage
```

**Cause:**
Private repo, typo in image name, or image doesnâ€™t exist.

**Fix:**

* Check Docker Hub or registry spelling.
* If private repo, login first:

  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

---

#### 5. **`Permission denied` when accessing volume or mount**

**Cause:**
File system or Docker user permission issue.

**Fix:**

* Use correct permissions:

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /your/volume/path
  ```
* Avoid running containers as root unnecessarily.

---

#### 6. **`exec format error`**

**Error:**

```
standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "exec format error"
```

**Cause:**
Trying to run an image built for a different architecture (e.g., ARM vs x86).

**Fix:**

* Rebuild the image for your platform.
* Use `--platform` flag if supported:

  ```bash
  docker run --platform linux/amd64 myimage
  ```

---

#### 7. **`OCI runtime create failed`**

**Error:**

```
OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:367
```

**Cause:**
Low-level runtime issue (mount, cgroups, SELinux, etc.)

**Fix:**

* Restart Docker service.
* Reboot system if issue persists.
* Check for correct version compatibility.

---

#### 8. **`Docker build cache issues`**

**Symptom:**
Changes in code not reflected during build.

**Fix:**

* Use `--no-cache`:

  ```bash
  docker build --no-cache -t myimage .
  ```
* Or re-order Dockerfile instructions to invalidate cache properly.

---

#### 9. **`Cannot stop or remove container`**

**Error:**

```
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove
```

**Fix:**

* First, stop the container:

  ```bash
  docker stop container_name
  ```
* Then remove:

  ```bash
  docker rm container_name
  ```

---

#### 10. **`Docker-compose errors (yml indentation)`**

**Error:**

```
yaml.scanner.ScannerError: mapping values are not allowed here
```

**Cause:**
YAML formatting error (spaces or tabs).

**Fix:**

* Use a YAML linter.
* Ensure **2-space indentation** (no tabs!).
