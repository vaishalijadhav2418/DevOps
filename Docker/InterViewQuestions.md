  Scenario:
    You have a Java web application codebase hosted on GitHub. How would you set up a Jenkins job to build and deploy this application automatically whenever changes are pushed to the master branch?
    You notice that your Jenkins server is running slow, and jobs are taking longer to execute. How would you diagnose and resolve performance issues in Jenkins?
    You are tasked with implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application. Each microservice has its own repository in Git. How would you structure the Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy these microservices independently yet cohesively?
    One of your Jenkins jobs failed during the build process, and you need to investigate the issue. Walk me through the steps you would take to identify the root cause of the failure and fix it.
    Your team uses Docker containers for application deployment. Explain how you would integrate Jenkins with Docker to automate the containerization and deployment of your applications.
    You want to implement a deployment strategy that allows you to roll back to the previous version of the application in case of issues with the current release. How would you set up a Jenkins pipeline to achieve this, considering best practices for deployment?
    Your company is adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform. How can you incorporate Terraform scripts into your Jenkins pipeline to automate the provisioning of infrastructure alongside application deployment?
    Your team is developing a mobile application for iOS and Android. How would you configure Jenkins to build and test the app for both platforms, considering the differences in build and testing tools?
    Your team is considering migrating from a traditional Jenkins setup to Jenkins Pipelines (Jenkinsfile). Explain the benefits of using Jenkins Pipelines and the steps you would take to migrate existing jobs.
